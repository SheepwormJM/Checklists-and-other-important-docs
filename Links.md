How to do a systematic review - one where you formulate a specific question and seek to answer it
1. Want a protocol in place beforehand - publish somewhere if available: see http://www.prisma-statement.org/Protocols/ProtocolGuidance (an example protocol on PROSPERO - for human studies or animal models of human health, but this one is on cattle fasciolosis zoonosis - seems a little odd in concept, but hey ho).
